# Exhibit_Aeolian_Landscapes_Speed_Readout_Neopixel
Code to drive a LED neopixel ring with a speed readout that corresponds to how fast the fan is going. Now with new attract mode!

Code needs the neopixel library available at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel

Everything else should be pretty self-explanatory. Tested to run on an uno, needs a potentiometer with a 0v - 5v range.
